```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

First I'll attach my packages!

```{r, include = FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
library(DT)

```

Now we'll make an interactive graph of the iris data:

```{r}

iris_graph <- ggplot(iris, aes( x = Petal.Width, y = Petal.Length))+
  geom_point(aes(size = Sepal.Width,
                 color = Species))+
  labs(x = "Petal width (cm)",
       y = "Petal length (cm)",
       title = "Iris metrics by species")

iris_graph

ggplotly(iris_graph)
```

### Now I'll  make an interactive table with DT

```{r}
datatable(msleep)
```
